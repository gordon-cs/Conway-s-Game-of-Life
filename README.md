## **CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE**

The makefile contains 2 test methods. The first includes the test case included in the project instructions. It tests if a certian arrangement produces a spaceship and blinkers. There is an additional method that implements this arrangement at a different position. The second method generates a glider gun. This test ensures the program behaves consistently for 100 generations. 

To execute these methods, use `make <test name>` to execute one of the test methods. You will need to compile the executable before running these any test.
